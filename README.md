# Taxi-v3-SARSA-Reinforcement-Learning
This project implements an on-policy Reinforcement Learning agent using the SARSA algorithm to solve the Taxi-v3 environment. The agent learns an optimal policy to navigate the taxi, pick up passengers, and drop them at correct locations by maximizing rewards using a Q-table and an epsilon-greedy strategy with gradual decay.
